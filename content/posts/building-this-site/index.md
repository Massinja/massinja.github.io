Once you are familiar with Go Hugo, building a site like this one literally takes half an hour! If you're interested, feel free to reach out, and I'll be happy to help you set up your own site!

I said this and then spent a couple of days trying to make it obey me :D But now, I can ~~confidently~~ say it takes me about ~~half~~ an hour to set up a Go Hugo static site, that includes mostly time spent to customize it. That said, I actually enjoy troubleshooting and fixing Go Hugo issues more than starting from scratch. So, if youâ€™re encountering any problems, [message me](/contact/) and we'll think about them together. It will help me to solidify my Go Hugo knowledge. I am not a complete beginner per se, as I have pushed some quality commits to a couple of Go Hugo sites already: [here](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmtconfig.com/commits?author=Massinja) and  [there](https://github.com/purpleidea/purpleidea.com/commits?author=Massinja).  
Although, this blog still needs a lot of work, I am publishing it, as I would like to start somewhere.
